[This paper](http://www.aun.edu.eg/journal_files/143_J_4816.pdf) is used to develop **Naive Bayes** algorithm using federated learning.

## Run code with Visual Studio Code
-   Open the folder when the code is mapped
-   Install Python extension in order to run the script
-   Run the code

## Configurations:
The file `config.ini` can be used to change the parameters values.
Results in [results.txt](results.txt) file were obtained using local_learning and also federated_learning with the following parameters:
- n_parties: 2, 4, 6
- key_length: 1024
